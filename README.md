# PyBreakout
PyGame video tutorial game with added features (WIP)

Please be aware that this project is nearly 1:1 based on a PyGame Video Tutorial series. As such I am not the original creator of most of this code. I intend to expand the game's feature set over time.

Uses Python 3.5.X
Please use Game.py to launch the game.

Planned Features

**
Currently, the Main Menu is hotkey based. I intend to replace this with a Mouse driven UI using PyGame's own feature set.
**

**
A wider variety of Bricks is planned. Currently, the Ball Brick (+1 Balls) is not implemented, and most likely won't work in its current state if added to a level.
**

**
A SuperBrick is the only real addition to the game beyond what the Tutorial has you create. It takes 2 hits to destroy instead of one.
